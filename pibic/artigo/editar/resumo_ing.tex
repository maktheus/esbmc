The offside rule is one of the most controversial in a football game, but it is not common to study the background of it and discuss the scenarios in which offside occurs. The best known is the scenario of the attacker against the penultimate defender. It is common to think that only one defender is needed to prevent the opponent from being offside. However, since in almost all game situations the goalkeeper is under his goalposts, it is easy to forget that he also counts as a defender and for the rule. Another scenario concerns the ball line. When the attacker has already passed the last 2 defenders, he can make a pass to a teammate who is on the same line or behind the ball line. Finally, offside first occurs on the halfway line. If a player heads to attack and is before the halfway line, any pass in his direction can be made. However, if the last 2 defenders are in the attacking field and the attacker is after the halfway line, any ball directed at him will be considered offside. The reading and basis used for this work will be consolidated research that has already managed to successfully reproduce the proposal or that served as a basis for other works in the area and are valid for this one.
